# weather-app

This application implements async functions to fetch data from a free API and manipulate the data for display.

Along with weather, location is finagled from the same source as well.

Settings can be adjusted using the settings menu that slides out on click of the cog in the upper right corner.

On click of the three dots to the bottom right of the current weather icon, additional details are displayed.

Site is responsive. 

I designed the main weather icons myself in Inkscape.
